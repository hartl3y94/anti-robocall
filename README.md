# Anti-Robocalls

I'll just cut to the chase: __I HAVE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERFUCKING ROBOCALL SCAMMERS FUCKING WITH ME!!!1__ So, I decided to join the e-war against them by making a blacklist of scammer numbers.

Currently, I'm just taking note of scammers who personally gave me a ring. The file where I record their numbers is in [myblacklist.csv](./blacklist/myblacklist.csv). Keep in mind that [caller ID spoofing is a thing](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id), and unless the phone number on the list has a RoboKiller.com entry, don't assume that it's bad (scammers are crafty and probably are spoofing caller ID).

In the future when I have more entries and larger datasets, I'll do some statistical analysis of the data and probably try to develop techniques to thwart/troll robocallers and other scammers.
